While server-side controls the function on the back end, client-side is what users interact with. Fundamentally I think server-side is more important because one function can have many skins but still without some kind of client-side it is useless for most so they are pretty close to being equal. The most important part of their interaction is the speed of the communication and the flexibility to manipulate the server-side with the client-side.
